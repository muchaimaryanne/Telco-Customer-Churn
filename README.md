# Customer Churn Prediction
This project is a part of the [Azubi Africa Data Analytics Professional Program](https://cloud-school.thinkific.com/courses/ds-career-accelerator-lp3-classification-project)  Other projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne?tab=repositories).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.


### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Univariate Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* OneHot Encoding
* Random Forest Classiffier Modelling
* Gradient Boost Classiffier Modelling
* Linear Regression Classiffier Modelling

### Technologies
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Python
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* jupyter
* Seaborn
 

## Project Description
The project involves predicting likelihood of customer churn and finding out the factors that influence the decision to churn. The dataset is from a telco organisation and the target variable is the churn column.

The hypothesis are as follows:

*Null Hypothesis: The longer a customer's tenure , the lesser the likelihood that the customer will churn.*

*Alternate Hypothesis: A customers tenure does not determine the likelihood of a churn.*

We used Pandas profiling to do EDA on this project.
Our visualizations are done using Matplot lib and Seaborn.
The models used for prediction are:

* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boost Classifier
* Linear Regression Classifier
